# Pomodoro Timer
This is a simple Pomodoro Timer web app built using React and Vite. You can try it out here: https://pomodoro-timer-pearl-delta.vercel.app/. The app enables users to seamlessly switch between Pomodoro, Short Break, and Long Break phases. The code was built with the help of GitHub Copilot. As a learning exercise, the UI/UX is implemented as closely as possible to [Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/).
